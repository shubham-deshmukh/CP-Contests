# CSES Problem Set

## Graph Algorithms

### Counting Rooms

- DFS or BFS

### Building Roads

- DFS
- Connected Components

### Message Route

- BFS

### Building Teams

- DFS (Coloring)

### Round Trip 

- DFS (Detect & print the cycle)

### Shortest Path - I

- Dijkstra's Algorithm : Single source shortest path (with no negative egde)
- TODO required
    - Implementation with default priority queue is not working
    - Approach Reference : Competitive Programmer's Handbook (Page 128)

### Shortest Path - I (Using Set)

- Dijkstra's implementation using set

### Shortest Path - II

- Floyd-Warshall

### Flight Discount

- Dijkstra (Single Source Shortest Path with no-negative weight)
- There are two approaches 
    - Without Graph Modelling
    - Graph Modelling (using state)
- TODO required
    - Solve using graph modelling approach

### Cycle Finding

- Bellman ford 
    - Detection of negative weight cycle
    - Print the cycle

### Flight Routes

- Dijkstra
    - Generalization of Dijkstra for K shortest distance
    - Nice problem to understand Dijkstra's working in detail
